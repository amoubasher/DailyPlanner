In this challenge, we were supposed to make a daily planner in which a user will be able to update their planner and sort out their day.
Some logic that was added to the JavaScript is to make the hour of the day that has passed to turn gray, and the present hour to turn red. That will tell the user that this hour has passed and 
their planner will not update it. Also, the user will be able to save certain tasks to their local memory so that if they decide to close the page, it will
still remember what they have to do.

The page is dynamic as it saves the date and shows the current day. The hours that it passes are only from 9AM-5PM, meaning that the user is subjected to an 8hr planner.



Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
